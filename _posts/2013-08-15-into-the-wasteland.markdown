Today is one of the big focal points for my trip - I'm venturing into the areas surrounding Fukushima and want to see how close I can get to the exclusion zone surrounding the site of the March 2011 nuclear disaster.

Clear facts about the aftermath aren't easy to come by, and a lot of what you hear or read is speculation and hyperbole, instead of rational thought and facts. I've done my internet-armchair-expert research, this is clearly a low-risk activity. Let's do some back-of-the-envelope risk analysis. Here's some **radiation dosage charts**, presume that they're sufficiently accurate:

* [http://xkcd.com/radiation/](http://xkcd.com/radiation/)
* [http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/radiation-dosage-chart/](http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/radiation-dosage-chart/)

Depending on the source, they're either instantaneous dosages or averaged over a year. Let's say that we're willing to receive a free cranial CT scan and **will cop a 10 millisievert dose** for the sake of adventure. Ten times that (100 mSv) would be "pretty scary", and fourty times that (400 mSv) as an acute dose might make you noticeably ill. Whether you accept this assessment is a personal decision, but it's an objective baseline to work with.

Given this, what **exposure** can be expected? The XKCD chart suggests 1 milisievert over two weeks in the exclusion zone, with the caveat that some areas are "much higher". The latter link suggests about as much in 1 hour at Fukushima, one day after the disaster. In other words, **not very much**. Pragmatically speaking, the government is making the calls on where is and isn't safe to go anyway - that'll be my real guideline for this adventure, and it's likely to be very conservative and risk-averse. Besides, I'm too much of a pussy to go fence-jumping into areas I clearly shouldn't be, much as I might fancy myself to be one.

So with all that said, the actual **exclusion zone boundaries aren't clear**, based on various bits that I can find. This list, at least when it was written, highlights [several towns that are in or around the zone](http://www.safeandgreencampaign.org/action-center/past-actions-and-events/voices-of-fukushima/towns-in-fukushima-exclusion-zone). Minami-Soma is a useful landmark because it's on the go/no-go border. I'm pretty much flying blind apart from this, and I'll see how far I can go. What I can discern:

* Hirono: should be accessible
* Kawauchi: should be accessible, expected to be abandoned
* Iitate: not enough details, may be accessible, considered a risk area
* Naraha: abandoned, unclear if checkpoint still in place
* Minami-Soma: frontier on the perimeter, should have green/amber/red zones?
* Tomioka: abandoned and expected to be off-limits without government authorisation, possibly revised to partial-access

I'm gonna start driving and play it by ear. No grand plan, I'll just follow whatever road seems to be leading towards Minami-Soma and then see about these no-go boundaries.

I get off the highway at Haramachi, which appears to be the CBD for "Minami-Soma city". Well, I've kinda reached my original destination, now what?

I'm not sure what I was inspecting, but it's not like there's any checkpoints staffed by tough-as-nails security forces. Guess I'll keep going after I get some refreshment.

I thought I pulled off the Rikuzenhama highway, but you'd be forgiven for being mistaken. The highway is one lane in each direction in places, with no shoulder or buffer to speak of. Happy to have more of a chance to think and take in the surroundings, I continue on south.

It's not long until I hit Odaka, and at once I know it. This is it, the place is abandoned. I've been passing through small towns and roadside attractions the whole way down so far, but now I've found somewhere that's just... barren. The "highway" road is noticeably of higher grade than everything else in town, but it's all the same, all quiet. I pull over into the carpark of a small medical clinic or what used to be one. I need to get some bearings, and I need to start exploring.

There's an uncomfortable tension between my immediate surroundings in the car and The Outside. I've got food, water, and reception on my smartphone, yet I feel profoundly alone and vulnerable the moment I step out of the car. A hot wind buffets my face and I duck back inside to consider my options.

I walk around a little bit to try and get a feel for the area, but I'm wary of leaving the safety of the car, even though I've calmed down a bit since arriving in town. It's quiet so I could *swear* that I can hear someone moving in a big long shed-like structure next door, but I can't tell for sure. I think I can make out the shape of an old woman's head, but maybe I'm imagining it. It's too dark inside the shed building, and any movement is very slow and infrequent.

I'm at Odaka Commercial School now, I guess it's a high school with specialisation.

This used to be a real Japanese school, something I only know as a stereotype. Real people attended here, they stood where I stand now, and used this storeroom. It's just... eerie.

The bugs are giving me the willies. I really want to walk down the little road to the adjacent road, but I feel like I'm being watched and just can't shake the anxiety. Besides, the weeds are fucking huge and I don't feel like dealing with that either, and whatever bug keeps flying noisily around my head.

Caption: Piles and piles of books and papers in a classroom; why?

It's time to bail. Stress is getting the better of me, and I spot a small vehicle (a mini patrol car) going along the road in the far distance. Did someone spot me and call it in? Shit, what if they did... I can't lose here, it's time to keep moving. This isn't even the most exciting thing around. I get back in the car and get out of Dodge. There's a patrol car driving down one of the side streets, into which I throw an aggressive reverse two-point turn and roll out.

{% insert_image 20130815-042-IMGP0670.jpg %}

There's a carpark down here and a clear entrance area to what I think is a park... or maybe it's just for this shrine. But the aesthetic of the carpark doesn't match the shrine at all. I'd jump the turnstiles but I can't see any!

I really want to go pee right now, and there's a toilet here but... I really don't want to use this toilet. I figure I'm actually better off just using one of the bushes, which somehow is decently kept. Someone must be maintaining the gardens here...

{% insert_image 20130815-044-IMGP0673.jpg %}
