Kurisu's jacket is finally finished! Not a moment too soon either, I'm quite relieved. It wasn't terribly hard, I just had to get it done.

Caption: Almost done! Only the bottom trimming remains. The zipper isn't actually needed, it's just there so you can see where it would normally go.

Caption: The arm belts to hold the jacket in place when it's not on her shoulders, I'll clip the ends shorter before using them.

Cutting up the reference-jacket was definitely the right way to go, it was fairly straightforward and the results are pleasing. You'll be able to see the finished product when I get some photos taken.
