So I haven't been posting since I got back, I've been more occupied by things than I expected to be. Oh well.

Last weekend a friend and I were meant to drive to Kingsford from my place. It's about a 15-20min drive, not terribly far, but we were running a tiny bit late for a 10am appointment.

We got in her car, turned the key, and were greeted by a weak chugging, whirring sound, followed by a ratcheting crunch. Of course we tried again - it was just like in the movies when even though they know exactly what's happened, they tap the fuel gauge in a vain attempt to convince the cold heart of reality that she might be wrong.

She never is.

It's kinda weird being an introvert sometimes. I knew what had to be done, and I felt my heart beat more heavily. This should be no big deal, I just have to knock on a few doors and ask if they can help us jump-start the car. The street's full of cars, it's not like it can't be done. The logical part of my mind is raving non-stop about how this is a non-issue for so many reasons, and the rest of me is telling it to shut up.

I've lived in Glebe for about six years now, it's a fantastic place. Truth is, up until now I knew exactly *none* of my neighbours. There's the odd person moving in, community barbeques, stuff like that, but I can't bring myself to get involved. There's nothing wrong with them, there's just a big mental barrier for me to deal with, so I don't because it's the easy option.

In this case I knew I was being assessed and relied upon by someone else. Relax, this should be easy... And really it was. I tried the place two doors down, the bloke there suggested another guy by name who owns a Land Rover. Both warm and friendly and easy to talk to. With the car started, we were on our way and arrived only half an hour late.

*Uplifting* is the way I think I'd describe it, just a little bit. It felt like I'd done something really right, even though it was only for myself. For *anyone* else that I know, that would've been a completely ordinary situation, but I feel a bit more confident about dealing with new people now. I'll take that and do my best with it.
