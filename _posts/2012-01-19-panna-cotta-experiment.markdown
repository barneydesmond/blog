title: Panna cotta experiment

{% include post_header.html %}

AstCd2 has been stuck at home lately (I use "stuck" generously, he's taking annual leave off work) and is at a loose end for food.

While it's not exactly sustenance, panna cotta *is* delicious. It's also [really easy to make](http://www.taste.com.au/recipes/15191/vanilla+bean+panna+cotta), so he has no excuse. :)

Use 2 teaspoons of vanilla essence instead of a real vanilla bean, because we're lazy. Bon appetit!
