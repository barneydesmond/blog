Went to help out on a shoot today around Bicentennial Park and Homebush Station. Figuring I might as well have a camera, I hauled along the D800 with 80-200/2.8 attached.

Outdoor lighting was way too harsh for a lot of impromptu shooting, but silhouettes are pretty cool.

The Cityrail staffer on duty at the station was kind enough to let us through the gates, and we shot some nice stuff through golden hour. With sunlight streaming in through the station entrance I realised that something nice could probably had with contrasty shadows, so I flipped over to b/w.

And this is what I spent a few hours on last night, exercising my weak photoshop-fu. This guy's [howto](http://www.nextgenupdate.com/forums/call-duty-modern-warfare-2-discussion/95400-mw2-font.html) was most helpful on achieving the text effects.

Once the sun was gone, we bailed out and wrapped up the shoot with a few structures around the ANZ stadium.

It looks like the whole area is set for a big V8 racing event coming up soon, there's concrete barricades lining some of the roads and viewing platforms nearby. It'd be pretty cool to drive down I reckon.
