# Comiket 79 doujin acquisitions

This is not comprehensive, just the stuff I could get out of my luggage easily.

## eefy

* new book “Revery!”

As a “A”-column wall-circle this was my first target.

> は？なにこれ。。？
> 「すみません、さいこうびですか？」
> 「ええ、どうぞ♫」

There was literally one guy in front of me in the queue. GETTO DA ZE~!

[My doujin-hon can’t possibly be this cheap!](http://eefy02.xsrv.jp/0kkkokuti.jpg)

Actually, I’m kinda worried that I only got the book, and missed something else there :/ Can’t dismiss the thought that I should’ve gotten more than a pair of copies.


## lunatic joker

* book + clearfile set

Second on the hit-list, had no trouble grabbing four of these for 4,000yen of damage. God knows why lunatic joker isn’t a wall/shutter circle; probably not even gentei’d.


## dmyo

* book + clearfile set
* La Vie en Rose (multiple artists collaboration)

On my way over to Z-column, this was another easy get. Two of them for 600yen damage each.


## nozomi

* Espoir
* Asterism

Wildcard impulse purchase, this artist sorta has the Naoko Takeuchi-esque paint spattering technique happening.


## Nardack

* BUTTERFLY GARDEN book + clearfile + postcard set
* Artworks 2008-2010

God this is gorgeous. Island-circles ftw.


## Soy->Sause

* Cigarette personification book

Impulse purchase. I really love finding stuff that’s a bit off-the-wall, or simply different. Anthropomorphosis has like a +10 bonus vs. my wallet.

I think this is because in my mind I associate a greater deal of passion for the work. Is this exploitative? Sure, but if you’re moe-fying cigarettes, I bet you really love your tobacco. That says a lot to me personally.


## Woyoyo(?)

* Tea Time – Tea personification illustration book

Another impluse buy, see above. I’ve heard of hardly any of these teas, and I live in a Britannian colony! Apparently the teas featured in the book were sold at a cafe the artist used to frequent. That’s passion.

[[homepage](http://otowa.ciao.jp/)]


## Chokushin Helicoid / Shikaku Onchi

* Nostalgic Future

Impulse buy – Japanese people love their trains. This book is about the [Toden Arakawa Line (都電荒川線)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toden_Arakawa_Line), a streetcar tram system. Just little observations about things seen along the route. The minimalist art style was quite attention-getting, helped by being on the end of a column.


## Totenkreuz

* World Tuning System

An easy buy at 840yen, full-colour.


## Kazuharu Kina

* Heikou Shoujo Sekai
* Shouzou Shoujo


## Tohru Adumi

* Pretty Cute Charming

またfull-colour. There were other things on the table, but given my illiteracy and poor comprehension, the story and drama CD set couldn’t be justified.


## tearfish

* Fuyu no Mori

Column-end table. Their table-mate (canaria mint?) was queued up, but tearfish was easy. I spent a minute perusing the offerings then picked up the shiny new full-colour book.


## COSMIC FORGE

* new book “chocolate drops”

You don’t say no to girls with chocolates.


## Nekoyanagi

* book + minibook + bag set
* Chapeau #06

I’m really glad I got this when I did. I hadn’t hit any shutter circles so I didn’t have a bag to carry things in, and the pile on my arm was a couple of inches thick by the time I got here.


## Angeltype

* Inu-Sakuya book + clearfiles + mousepad + ?? set

いぬさくやさん　だ～い好き！


## Der Wald

* Classic

I also 大好き regular Sakuya-san.


## tangent

* Present

Impulse purchase. The cover art style reminds me greatly of Oyari Ashito’s earlier works.


## Lunade Luna

* toho antique book + mini-calendar set
* Boku no jinsei wo kimi ni ageru – CD

My research had suggested that Lunade Luna’s table would be at some inconvenient wall/shutter location, so I was quite surprised when I shuffled past some island tables and saw a saikoubi marker. I think this was the one thing I ever had to queue for at ‘ket this year.

This was also my introduction to the “fake saikoubi” – it’s what they use to mark the end of a queuing block and point to the next segment of the queue. This is done because snaking a crowd of people around a very crowded hall is a Bad Idea, so they manage it in chunks.

Advice for the new kids: the real saikoubi sign uses three kanji. The fake saikoubi takes four kanji, meaning you should look around for the next chunk or just ask someone. Or you could attempt to like, learn the kanji themselves. *shrug*


*Boku no jinsei wo kimi ni ageru* is a CD (songs plus a long drama track) by Samurai Girl that Lunade Luna did the cover art for.

Maaaan, the fujoshi next to me in the queue seemed really awkward and nervous; I think she was talking to herself. There’s certainly selection bias in my observations, but all the girls attending that I usually notice are calm, collected, and well turned-out. I guess social awkwardness isn’t just for the guys.


## H-colors (check this when I get back)

* colorful
* ?? toho illustration book


## meola

* A.L 01
* A.L 02
* Collapse of the sky

Collapse of the sky is a CD by yuyoyupe that meola did the art for.


## TIES

* OreImo book + extrabook new set (not sure of contents)
* Zutto Fire Sisters

One of my comrades decided to hit up TIES, so I asked them to grab me a set. As a result, it’s one of the few 18+ things I got.

Oh Kuroneko-chan, I’m so ハァハァ for you


## Alphonse

* White Radio book + clearfile + poster set

What can I say? DAMN. I don’t even remember how I found their table, or how much I paid. This was just so gorgeous I had to hit it, twice.


## Dhiea

* the equinoctial line book + clearfile, new set (not certain of contents)

A member of a circle with Alphonse, unless I’m mistaken.


## Kantoku / Afterschool of the 5th year

* book + folder new set

Also a comrade-purchase. I was umm-ing and ahh-ing about this one, but it wasn’t too expensive in the end, so I took it off their hands. I haven’t watched KamiNomi yet, so I don’t know if this’ll necessarily be a hit for me.


## Oyari Ashito

* book + artbook + bag new set

This was a no-brainer for me. NOCCHI’s art seems to gather heavily divided reactions, but I’ve liked it for a long time. While the main book here is Kuroneko-exploitation, the side-book has some great coloured works, so I think it comes out on top for me.

Besides, the front cover is Kokoro-chan (「こころちゃん」ってういな！), and she’s a short, blonde, twin-tailed, tsuntsun lolikko.

*A++++ would take home again!!*

# Comiket hitlist

Since C75 all our tastes have become a bit more refined, and we know how to restrain ourselves a little more. Neither a larger stack of books, nor waiting 3hrs in line for moe goods assures feelings of self-satisfaction.

More than anything else, we want to have a good time – you have to learn to take it easy. Fuck camping out all night, leave it for the “pros”. Hang out with your bros instead.

Each day tends to have an overarching theme:

* Day 1 – Industry booths
* Day 2 – Touhou
* Day 3 – All the stuff that you want, all on the same fucking day

Industry booths are open on all three days, but all the hard-to-get merchandise will sell out on day 1, hence the rush.

Some things haven’t changed: Nanoha is still ridiculously popular, and fans will queue for hours to get the merch.



# Day 1 – Cosplay

Remember how I said that Day 1 is Industry day? Yah well y’know what; fuck it.

We’re lining up for industry halls on day 1, but the whole place is a shitstorm of crowds and queues. We’ll have a look to see if there’s anything worth buying, but life is meaningless without Littlewitch in the house.

Ayu and I had roughly agreed earlier that if we were going to cosplay, day 1 was the day for it. It’s what I’ve packed a 15kg “overnight bag” for, and I’ll be damned if that’s going to waste.

Besides, dovac makes an adorable Kirino, and we can’t let this chance for him to unleash his imouto-radiance pass.



# Day 2 – Touhou

Despite the name of this page, I wasn’t specifically after a lot of Touhou. I’m happy to take whatever I can find that looks interesting.

* Lunade Luna – East halls – O-41a
* meola – East halls – Y-13b
* 38 BEETS – East halls – P-46a
* Dhiea – east halls – S-45b

There was no big Maikaze item to acquire this time (thank christ), so it was all very easy-mode.



Day 3 – everything else
Ordered by priority then optimised roughly for an efficient path

Must-hit (or investigate with high priority):

* eefy A-34

* Wada Rco Z-39b
