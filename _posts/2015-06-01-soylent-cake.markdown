I've been trying out this Soylent thing recently, there's finally a local supplier ([Aussielent](http://aussiesoylent.com.au/)) that makes it easy to purchase. I could find a way to ship it in, or make it myself, but I'm *lazy*.

So I picked up a month's supply, just in case they have delivery problems in future or something. I'm not going all-out with it, but it's replacing a good number of meals at the moment, and I still snack other things (naughty me). I reckon it's not bad, and it's easy to prepare so long as you have some kitchen scales around (cup measures are a bit hit and miss).

I got bored and decided I wanted to make cake with it. It's mostly flour so it should work, right? I dug up the [simplest recipe I could find](http://www.bestrecipes.com.au/recipe/plain-cake-L1073.html) and set to work.

* 1.5 cups soylent
* 0.5 cups self-raising flour
* 0.75 cups caster sugar
* 125g butter
* 2 eggs
* 1 cup milk
* Pinch of baking powder

Small modifications were made: Retain some self-raising flour to aid in binding the batter, and use a full cup of milk instead of two-thirds, to get the right consistency. Throw everything in a big bowl, mix it up, then pop it in the oven.

Caption: It's pretty thick and needed a good deal of extra milk to achieve a normal batter consistency.

I was thinking that ideally you could replace your meals with cake, but the other ingredients add a lot of kilojoules, so you can't just eat cake all day. Starting with about one serve of soylent (2600 kJ) it blows out to about 11000 kJ once you make the cake; the sugar (2550 kJ) and butter(3750 kJ) are absolute killers.

Caption: The appearance and texture reminds me a lot of Mooncake.

As for the cake, I reckon it's alright. The inside is a bit dense but that could be due to a whole bunch of reasons, like me being a terrible chef, or [our oven](http://www.euromaid.com.au/DISCONTINUED-PRODUCT/MC110T.htm) being crap. It's like [mooncake](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mooncake) which really isn't unpleasant. I'd like to find a way to make it with fewer kilojoules though, I'm sure there's a way.
