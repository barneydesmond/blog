## Camping

Sleep? No. We haven't even started and it already feels like I'm running on empty.

Taxi to Big Sight, enqueued in a block on the main walkway up to the pyramids.

One of the great things about Japan is how orderly it is. We left our spots
(guarded by the dozing Ayu) and went off to take it easy on some benches, safe
in the knowledge that we'd still have our place in line when we got back.

* Konbini food is delicious at 4 o'clock in the morning
* It's still *really fucking cold* at winterket, no matter how much you think you've rugged up this time around


## Industry booths

As predicted, industry halls have nothing for us, and thus sucked. The big
thing going this year is K-On "life goods". It's a set of stuff like teatowels,
hand-soap dispensers, tissue-box covers, drink coasters, etc. all for
toomany-thousand yens.

You can have your life goods branded with
[Mio](http://www.cospa.com/detail/id/00000037023),
[Azu-nyan](http://www.cospa.com/detail/id/00000037022) or
[Yui](http://nijigencospa.com/detail/id/00000037021). The obvious indie-hipster
choice of Ritsu isn't available, sorry.


## Cosplaying

They've moved the male cosplay changeroom this year, it's now in the atrium of
the west halls and looks like a big white medical tent. We got there "pretty
early", but already the floorspace was getting full. I guess the cosplayers in
attendance tend not to bother with doujin-buying at all.

I can understand that - trying to do both is unbelievably stressful because the
necessary preparations for each are highly incompatible. If I had things my way
I'd have just rolled up at 10am, well-slept and nicely groomed.

Having comrades for this gig is a new experience for me, I don't know how to
describe it. It feels... good? Sure I've cosplayed in a group before, but I've
always felt a bit detached from the existing circle of friends.

> *The weariness and fatigue from your recent exploits is completely dissipated in the good company of friends, replaced by a radiant confidence.*
>
> *There is a spring in your step, and everything seems a little brighter, the air a little fresher. The camera bag on your shoulders seems lighter as you contemplate your quest.*

Yeah anyway. Since I last cosplayed at C75 I've wanted to do it again,
properly. Or at least better. Ayu deserves many thanks for giving me an excuse
to be his twin sister Kagamine Rin, and dovac for being *Ore no imouto*.

It's remarkably fulfilling to have people ask for photos, and it happened a
good number of times. By Ayu's reckoning there were many more requests here
than any US convention he's attended in the past, which is probably quite a
few, given that he's been cosplaying since 2003 (a bit longer than me). He was
absolutely bossing it, handing out namecards to other cosplayers after taking
photos.

As positive reactions go it's a close call between a group of local vocaloid
cosplayers flipping their shit (en-AU translation: freaking the fuck out) at
getting cards from a gaijin, and a web news channel deciding that we looked
interesting enough to interview \o/

Personal favourite: walking past two cute girls in cosplay who'd clearly been
checking us out, smiling, and getting an "OMGOMGOMG!!" response - I won't lie,
I felt like such a boss in that moment.

Sorry, no photos of us for you. Maybe this is a common problem, I'm not sure;
we're both photographers people who want to cosplay. If noone else if your
party is photographically inclined, you're kinda screwed and can't get awesome
photos :<

We were going to call it quits for the day until we spotted a row of pimped-out
cars from the plaza on top of the west halls - itashas! Unless you're otherwise
involved, these things are funny beasts. They're garish and tend to be done
with a "more is better" aesthetic, but for some reason they're often fun to
look at.

I'm not a "car person", but Ayu is and he's having a ball.

Super Sonico is a commercial piece, it belongs to Nitroplus rather than the
usual deranged otaku with money to burn. [This
dude](http://www.banpei.net/blog/itasha-super-sonico-stratos) has some photos
from less AWESOME angles.

The [Lancia Stratos HF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lancia_Stratos_HF) was hot
stuff in the mid-70's, though a friend points out this is probably a kit car
and not an original - the body panels line up too well for a real Lancia :P

Absolutely buggered. Got a taxi back to Shin-Kiba, we didn't bother changing
back into civvies first. I'm all for blending-in while in Japan, but fuck it I
like my cosplay. Somehow didn't collapse into bed face first. Akira isn't
giving me flak about trapping like I expect he might, I guess he's actually not
fussed, or too tired to care. Tomorrow will be... interesting.
