It seems I'm back again. Like last time, I didn't sleep at all the night before my flight. I've had cosplay on my mind for the last few days, specifically that I wouldn't get it done before departure.

I'm painfully aware that once I'm in Japan, doing any sewing for my [Robotics;Notes](http://moin.meidokon.net/furinkan/cosplay/Robotics_Notes) cosplay will be *really really hard*. There's also a deadline of the time that we actually get out to Tanegashima and Yakushima. I'll figure something out.

I also fucked up royally and went to the international terminal at Sydney airport - forgot about that domestic leg of the trip. >_<

Caption: I'm glad the plane for the long leg of the journey has seats in a 2-4-2 configuration. I've got an aisle seat, which means I can go to the toilet whenever I feel like it.

We took the Keisei Skyliner instead of the NEX this time, as it's slightly cheaper. It's a good train, we'll definitely take it again if it's more convenient.

Caption: A ticket for the Keisei is 2,400 yen, which is 600 yen less than the NEX. It's zippy, too, taking 40min to get to Ueno.

We don't have internet access yet, but we managed to get to Akiba and crash at the hotel. We're at Via Inn, the same place I stayed in when I last visited with Omochikaeri nine months ago.
