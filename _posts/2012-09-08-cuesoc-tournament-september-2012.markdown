Got asked to help shoot video for a UNSW CueSoc tournament. Despite not knowing anything at all about 9-ball, I agreed to go along and it was good fun.

The D800 is great to shoot video with, it just feels so natural and effortless. I'm probably a terrible camera operator, but I thought I managed okay.

This was also a good chance to stretch the legs of the D800 a bit. City Heroes pool hall on George Street is *dim*; shooting at a fairly constant f/4, the ISO was regularly pushed up to get a clean shot. I think in this case the output favours very gentle noise reduction, so the images stay nice and crisp without being overwhelmed by noise.
