I swear comiket is always like this, there's *one day* that has all the stuff
you want, while the other two days are yukkuri. Today is that friggen' day.

Getting even less sleep than the past two nights, we're out to queue even
earlier. Turns out it's the same story for everyone else, it was definitely
busier this morning. Hell, we're queuing to queue up :<

We spend our time standing in line rehearsing our circle hit-lists, poring over
the dead-tree catalogue one last time. Mine's pretty ambitious, I've got 20
circles prioritised into must-get (eefy and lunatic joker), do-want, and
acquire-if-feasible.

It was a cakewalk. We had pretty-good spots in the outside carpark queues, but
I didn't even have to wait for eefy (a wall circle!), and lunatic joker was an
easy line-up. Staffers in cosplay had us in two lines snaking across a few
columns of tables. The girl standing next to me seemed normal enough, but she
was fidgeting alot and avoiding eye contact with anyone else. I could swear she
was muttering something under her breath repeatedly, I guess even fujoshi are
really awkward.

The only thing I couldn't get was 東M-12, Firstspear - it was
[*kanbai'd*](http://jisho.org/words?jap=kanbai). This is the guy who's
[moe-fied the governor of Tokyo](http://www.firstspear.com/sarutore/) to speak
out against the proposed "loli ban" legislation, so its popularity is kinda
understandable.

With the east halls exhausted I wandered over to the west halls. All the
circles I'm interested in are on the wall or shutters, so it's basically a lost
cause. I do, however, spot the other cosplay display area used at Big Sight.
It's the one with rolling green mounds like a minigolf course, and it takes me
a fucking eternity to figure out how to get down there while navigating stairs,
one-way corridors and taped-off sections. It's nice, but it's really too
cramped by now, and I'm carrying too much.

## ZettaiWatch

Wanting nothing more from the day I met up with Omochikaeri and Retro' on the
entrance plaza, where we spent the last precious hours of daylight sitting down
watching the zettai ryouiki pass us by.

It's really very therapeutic, I'd suggest you try it.


## Tonari de cosplay (となコス)

The event's name is a giveaway, it's literally a neighbouring cosplay event to
comiket [[homepage](http://www5c.biglobe.ne.jp/~yuusya/tona.htm)]. In its
favour it does stay open much later than comiket, but it'd still be awful
trying to buy doujin at 'ket, then go cosplay at TonaCos :/

Since our last trip two years ago I've wanted to investigate this cosplay event
that's held in parallel with comiket, at the TFT building next door. Nadleeh
and Madara were there at the time, you can recognise the venue because it
appears in So Many Cosplay Photos It's Not Funny. Seriously:

* Birch-coloured wood panelled walls and polished wooden floors like a modern lecture theatre
* Tiled carpets in the common areas
* That Bloody Balcony overlooking the walkway outside
* White marble pillars near the glass walls



I think I managed to round up Doc and/or cyan before we went over to check it
out, the power-level of this thing is **huge**.

It's inexcusable that I've done no research into this, but it was pretty
intimidating after seeing a staffer chase off some tourist trying to take
photos through the windows. There wasn't really an obvious entrance, and it
looks like an event for cosplayers and photographers only. Without gawking
you've *gotta* be a participant, which seems commendable to me.

With Omochikaeri as our six-foot-tall bleached-blonde trump card, we
entertained the thought of
[*gaijin-smashing*](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=gaijin%20smash)
our way in there. We did decide against it in the end, but I'll be back one
day, mark my words...


## Checking out

Taxi back to Shin-Kiba, dinner at Sukiya again (またスキヤのですか！＞＿＜).
We're getting lots of weird looks from people, I guess they could smell the
bags of doujin. I swear some university weightlifting team rolled in halfway
through our meal, thank christ for someone else drawing aggro off us.

We eventually got our shit together, lots of packing up to be done. Everyone
else is staying at Shin-Kiba for a final night, while Ast and I are hotfooting
it back to Sakura Hotel. Carted all our stuff to the station (pain), to Tokyo
(lots of walking once again at Tokyo station), to Kanda (some pain carrying it
to Big Echo), fit all inside the karaoke room somehow.

We got the [*nomihoudai*](http://jisho.org/words?jap=nomihoudai) deal for
unlimited beer, so everyone got totally bellige. Dunno 'bout you, but I think
blasting out Only My Railgun at maximum volume is possibly one of the best ways
to ring in the new year.

Agi was flailing around like a madman after a few beers so we had to take the
bottles away from him. Eventually got a cab back to Sakura Hotel around 26:00,
best 980yen we've ever spent. I was planning to do some laundry this evening,
but y'know what? Zzzz.....
