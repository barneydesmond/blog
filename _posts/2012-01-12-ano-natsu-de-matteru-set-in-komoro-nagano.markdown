title: Ano Natsu de Matteru set in Komoro, Nagano
---

{% include post_header.html %}

Rather excited right now, I see that [AnoNatsu](http://www.ichika-ichika.com/) is sit in roughly the same area as Onegai Teacher. The Japanese fans of course determined this ages ago from the promo video, but there's been no details in English regarding this.

I should've thought to lookup the JP sites first - I [nutted it out](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search?search=aioi-cho) from seeing the streetsign for Aioi-cho in the episode and then [looking up the address through diddlefinger](http://diddlefinger.com/m/naganoken/komoroshi/402820/?ch=3-3-3&t=m).

A bullet list will do for now, I'm seriously hoping I can hit this up in March.

* About Komoro:
    * [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Komoro,_Nagano)
    * [Local tourism office (English)](http://hometown.infocreate.co.jp/en/chubu/komoro/komoro-e.html)
    * That looks like a positive match to me for the dam that Kaito is knocked off of: [Google Maps](http://g.co/maps/ahhjz)
* All about 8mm movie films:
    * Kaito has a [Fujica P300](http://www.super8data.com/database/cameras_list/cameras_fuji/fujica_p300new.htm) camera, it shoots [Single-8](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-8) film. While an anachronism now, it would've offered very good quality for its time (early- to mid-70s)
        * Another page about it [here](http://super8wiki.com/index.php/Fujica_P300)
        * The P300 specs quote a 10.5mm–27.5mm zoom lens. This is apparently multiplied by 6.5x to get the 35mm equivalent (about 68mm–179mm)
        * Learn some more about [Single-8](http://www.single8film.com/why.html)
    * Boxed cartridges of FUJICHROME R25N and FUJICHROME RT200N movie film can be spotted. The latter is the high-speed film that Kaito was testing when he got knocked off the bridge
        * Those are ISO-25 and ISO-200 films respectively, which is nigh on unfathomable these days
    * The P300 has a 160-degree shutter and runs at 18frames/sec. This means that each frame is exposed for a fixed (160/360)*(1/18)sec, or 1/40th sec.
    * Fujifilm has stopped producing new Single-8 filmstock, as of about 2007. The [official announcement](http://fujifilm.jp/information/articlead_0011.html) states (according to machine translation) that the last shipment of RT200N was in May 2010, R25N ceases in March 2012, and they'll no longer offer processing services as of September 2013 (sending it to them is the easiest way to get it processed now that it's so niche).
    * You can find these things on ebay
