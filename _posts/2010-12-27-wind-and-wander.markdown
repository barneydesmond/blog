08:00, cold, snowing outside. Packed beds as best we could, then breakfast.

A layer of fresh snow covered the ground, making it easier to navigate the driveway back to town. Left luggage at Shimizu, they offered to drop it off at the bus station in time for our ride, which was bloody good of them.

Spent the next few hours wandering around town doing more sightseeing. Light snowfall coming down making picture-taking somewhat difficult.

Hinamizawa is very much supported by tourist industries, so there's plenty of little souvenir shops around. We did our bit, I managed to nab a bottle of the local [doburoku](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sake). The elderly couple running the shop didn't quite speak English, but they'd obviously seen enough tourists like us in their time, and they were very cordial.

Not all of us made it to the bus in time, having made different arrangements for getting our luggage there. I the end, MrVacBob was perhaps 45sec late for our bus, so we chilled out at Takayama waiting for the next bus to arrive.

It's a long way back to Tokyo, a good five hours travel. But in good company it seems like a trifling matter. We spent the trip back chatting, swapping business cards, eating smoked cheese (it was offered on the food cart, how could you _not_?) and drinking beer. Oh yes, lots of beer, Trej and I made sure of that.

One day I'll get this right, at Tokyo station you have to exit the JR gates _twice_. Trying to start a journey on your Suica card by going through an exit-gate usually results in limited success. I swear I have the worst luck, noone ever speaks English when I have the rare need to hassle rail staff.

22:30, had gyuudon for dinner at Yoshinoya in Akiba. Joined up with some of the lulzfest crew while they were out on the town. Dropped a metric shittonne of yens on UFO catchers as a huge team, this sort of social activity is _dangerous_! Some of us were on fire pulling prizes like nobody's business, but the regularity with which 500yen coins were disappearing into the machines was somewhat disconcerting.

Even worse, we were crawling from one arcade to the next, looking for new machines with novel gameplay mechanics. I think we only went home in the end once we got kicked out of Don Quixote for closing time.
