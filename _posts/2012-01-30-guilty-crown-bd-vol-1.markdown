title: Guilty Crown bluray volume 1
---

{% include post_header.html %}

So the reason I bought the aforementioned bluray drive: **[Guilty Crown](http://www.guilty-crown.jp/)**. It was heavily oversold for what it ended up being, and almost bests Index/Railgun for the [chuu-ni byou](http://en.dic.pixiv.net/a/Chuunibyou) crown. I really love [redjuice's](http://redjuicegraphics.com/) designs though, and some of the characters are just so much fun to watch.

The blurays also come with {% jisho tokuten %} goods, which is what I was really after. The first bluray comes with a copy of the storyboard for ep01, prints of the endplate images, a CD with alternate mixes of the themes, and a little booklet with various nice things.

Caption: Clear plastic slipcase for the disc and storyboard book, it has some of the magic "wisps" sweeping across it

Caption: The storyboard book is 210 pages! It's always interesting to compare styles between designers (cf. [Ikuhara](http://mamesoku.com/archives/3229700.html), for example)

Caption: Lyrics for the insert song that accompanies badass usage of Void powers! I never realised it was in German


One of the cute extras on the bluray itself is the semi-animated 4koma shorts. About 30 seconds each, they're a facsimile of the printed strips in the booklet, with some motion and very cute voice acting. Very nice.

Worth it? Well, I think so. Amazon sells 'em for [about 5200yen](http://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B005WO7WE6), which I think is okay. I'm looking forward to volume 2, due for release next month and with more delicious goodies.
