So I've never actually gone to Sculpture by the Sea before. I decided to do it this year, aiming for a really early morning start to catch the sunrise. Thus, Sunday morning before church, I was off to the beach.

Taxi'd to Bondi beach because public transport kinda sucks at that hour (could've caught the 380 bus from the CBD), then got myself onto the coastal walk starting near the Bondi Icebergs.

Actually I was kinda aiming for darkness, which would be about 1.5 or 2 hours before sunrise. Sunrise is around 06:00, so bugger that. Besides, I didn't even get around to sleeping at all before heading out.

I popped the off-camera flash on a couple of these, I like what it did.

Boom, 6am and up comes the sun. God I love how the colours come out, I suspect we're just wired to love that orange/blue duality.

Caption: It's not terribly obvious, but that's meant to be a little paper boat. You probably can't tell from this angle; sorry.

My *God*, the number of people with tripods... I mean, I brought one with me in case I needed it but I wish I hadn't, I never used the damn thing. Mind you I was using a VR lens so I didn't have to care about handholding, but there really was no shortage of light.

Caption: Seriously what is that thing? It looks like a big mylar turd, or maybe a seashell.

The camera loves a bit of sea spray! There's a depressing lack of people willing to leave the path and go for some interesting shots. :<

Caption: This was a really nice installation, a cluster of little windmill-type things that make tapping noises as they spin. The sound was very soothing, not cacophonous at all.

There was a big collection of scultures in the wide open space at Mark's Park, about halfway between Bondi and Tamarama. Some nifty stuff there, but disconnected from the environment, so it didn't do as much for me.

It probably didn't help that the place was swarming with families by the time I got there. Kinda wish I'd gotten there earlier, but that's to be expected for a weekend.

A valiant Viking vessel! Just down on the rocks and not cordoned off at all, I don't know why more people weren't checking it out.

A dome covered in towels! This was planted on Tamarama beach, making for a very colourful attraction. There's a full rainbow of colour around the outer shell.

By the end of it I was pretty tired and it was getting hot. I think I brought the right amount of gear, save for the not-once-used tripod. If you can make it there early enough to avoid the crowds, especially on a weekday, it's a really lovely walk. The fact that I spent a bunch of time not even shooting scultures is testament to that.

[Sculpture by the Sea](http://www.sculpturebythesea.com/) runs until this Sunday, between Bondi and Tamarama beaches, so get your arse out there quick smart if you don't want to miss it.
