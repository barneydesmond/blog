A flood of good things arrived today.

* My camera came back from warranty repairs, Nikon gets a big thumbs up for getting it back so quickly (less than a week) &lt;3
* A shipment of Littlewitch merchandise arrived from Japan (many thanks, Shini)
* I have a new pointing device, a Razer Imperator. The Krait didn't have enough buttons

Then there's this, [which a colleague got from ebay](http://shortgirls.net/ZYZJYF)...
