Animania was [this weekend](http://animania.net.au/2012/sydney-september), I mostly socialised on Saturday and cosplayed on Sunday.

I guess this'll mostly be a photo post, though not a huge number of them. I had a good time with people and took some photos, I can't ask for much more than that.

Caption: The Rolls Royce [Silver Shadow](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolls-Royce_Silver_Shadow) is a huge car, something that's difficult to appreciate until you need to maneuver it out of a tight parking spot. England is visible in the reflection, we're going to take some photos of him with the Rolls.

Just for kicks, I brought one of the Einstein studio strobes and the battery pack, mounted on a lightweight stand. It's absurd overkill, but I wanted to try anyway. It's remarkably portable when fitted with just the plain reflector, though a proper umbrella or softbox would be preferable. My conclusion: it works, well, and is more than controllable enough to get the job done quickly.

Caption: Took this on the lower level of the [ATP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Technology_Park) carpark, well shaded by the high wall you can see in the background. The insane levels of light output make me cackle with glee.

Caption: Full-res from the camera, I'm really liking the airy feel. Einstein firing about quarter to half power through the rear windscreen.

Caption: In the front seat, covered in luxurious sheepskin.

Kevin's cosplaying Akemi Homura today, a few quick photos. The posing could use a little work to feel more natural, but it's getting there. Done in a very haphazard manner while waiting for other stuff to happen.

Gangnam Style? Or **Gundam Style**! This was a hilarious cosplay, then they proceeded to tear it apart in combat.

And that wraps up Saturday!

I'm cosplaying as [Ririchiyo](http://moin.meidokon.net/furinkan/cosplay/Shirakiin_Ririchiyo) from InuBoku today. The costume is barely finished, but it's *done*! I actually feel pretty good about it too, there's hardly anything that's ghetto about it.

[First shot](http://www.flickr.com/photos/xfire/8017955150/in/set-72157631608225089) for the day, from kuroneko. He's shooting my 105mm f/2 on a secondhand D3 he picked up recently. I'm so proud! I don't know why, but it gave me a really big warm-fuzzy feeling when he decided to jump ship from Canon.

Caption: SHO PRETTAY!

{% insert_image DS8_8749.jpg %}
Caption: It's so hard not to tease her, she's so damned adorable.

{% insert_image DS8_8750.jpg %}
Caption: Arcana Famiglia spotted! I think it's based on an otome game, so it's [full of guys](http://www.comfort-soft.jp/products/arcana/character.html). In its defence though, the girl *does* have delicious zettai ryouiki and a spiffy uniform to boot, so that's a win in my books.

I notice now that the 50mm f/1.4G didn't really like the strong backlighting and produced some veiling. The 24-70mm would probably have been fine, but being able to shoot faster indoors was nice.

{% insert_image DS8_8753.jpg %}
Caption: Dakimakura! Most notably, a Homura on the left, and Mary Clarissa Christie on the far right. I believe it's specifically [this art](http://danbooru.donmai.us/post/show/1263146) on the pillowcase. Shikkoku no Sharnoth is kinda niche, so it's nice to see here. Mmm, those heterochromia eyes~

{% insert_image DS8_8759.jpg %}
Caption: "What?" Taken during the Gangnam Style dance recording, featuring no small amounts of action with boys, thanks to Kuroko no Basuke being very popular right now.

{% insert_image DS8_8766.jpg %}
Caption: Gilgamesh is unfazed by the Kusomiso mask.

{% insert_image DS8_8778.jpg %}
Caption: Our photographers getting in on the action as well.

There's actually a few InuBoku cosplayers around. I can understand why; it's a really nice series and the uniforms are appealing.

{% insert_image DS8_8779.jpg %}
Caption: Ah, I recognise her! She was coordinating cosplay when SMASH was held at Town Hall, and she was Maria at Mini-Animania Sydney a couple of years ago. She really is about the right height, or maybe shorter.

{% insert_image DS8_8783.jpg %}
Caption: Karuta-chan~ equipped with the summer uniform, which features a dashing houndstooth pattern on the side panels.

{% insert_image DS8_8789.jpg %}
Caption: Inori from Guilty Crown, we had a couple showing the love over both days of the con.

{% insert_image DS8_8790.jpg %}
Caption: Gilgamesh remains impassive when faced with half a dozen dancing nekomimi maids.

{% insert_image DS8_8792.jpg %}
Caption: Undertaker from Kuroshitsuji.

{% insert_image DS8_8794.jpg %}
Caption: Tutturu~! We found a Mayushii from Steins;Gate.

So it turns out that Feiris already knows Mayushii. This means we can organise a group photoshoot sometime, though we're still missing an Okarin, which'd be kinda tragic. I'm looking forward to that though, probably in a month or so.

{% insert_image DS8_8816.jpg %}
Caption: High speed lolitas! They have to unwind too, you know.

After finishing dinner in the city I was *so* happy to get home, drop everything, and rest. Oh except that I didn't, I wanted to take some more photos first before getting changed >_>

{% insert_image DS8_8906.jpg %}
Caption: I'll admit I want to replicate some of the cheesecake that's featured in the series...
