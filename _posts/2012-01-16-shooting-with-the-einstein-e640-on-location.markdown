title: Shooting with the Einstein E640 on location

*Originally posted to my Google+ account, edited for current context*

This isn't actually that specific to the E640, it's more about dragging studio gear out into the field. I took some of the lighting kit out one morning last week for its first "real" test. Observations were made and lessons were learnt:

* The 24-70mm laughs like Okarin in the face of lens-flare, this is awesome!
  
  フゥーハハハハ！

* If you're planning on shooting without the camera in your hands, plan to pack a tripod

* If you're planning on taking a tripod, **remember to pack the bloody tripod!**

* The "Strobies Delta" RF shutter release is a great little unit, but couldn't manage more than several metres range without having the antenna extended. Maybe the batteries are running low

* Shot-bags would probably be useful, if inconvenient. Now I wonder how the big lightstand would hold up

* Seriously, they should use umbrellas on the Sydney-to-Hobart yachts, I bet they'd go even faster!

* Flash-sync speed is king if you're battling direct sunlight. Failing that, you need MOAR POWAH!

* Allow an extra hour of prep time when setting your alarm clock.

* Then set it back another hour.

And I still hate colour management. Why does the same file look different on Firefox, IE and Chrome?


I've written a little bit more about the units themselves, too. Go on and have a gander if you want to know more about this lovely gear.

Caption: Obligatory retro treatment; wasted potential never looked so good! So lemme get this straight - kids these days get nostalgic for a period of time that they never experienced. Colour me cyanotypedly cynical. [763 KiB]
