title: Minimum wage
vim: linebreak

I was curious so I tried to work it out. It is actually possible to earn less than "minimum wage" by being on an industry award wage that happens to be lower. I wonder how common that is, and how many people actually receive the minimum wage as-is.

It seems to be:

* $656.90 per week
* Which equates to $31,531 per year before tax
* That's about $29,000 after tax
* Which is $604 in your pocket per week after tax
