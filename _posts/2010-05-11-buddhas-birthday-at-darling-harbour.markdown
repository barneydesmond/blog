title: Buddha's Birthday at Darling Harbour
---

I'm not a religious person, but I'm not one to pass up a photo-taking opportunity when it's on my doorstep (though given the choice between Buddhism and Shinto, I'll take the latter). While it's not officially for a couple of weeks, celebrations were held [last weekend in Darling Harbour](http://www.nantien.org.au/en/news/News_View.asp?NewsID=264).

It was a nice mix of conditions for shooting; afternoon light, dusk and after-dark. The D90 was in for repairs, so I was limited to the D40 and couldn't haul the 80-200/2.8 along with me (no focus motor).

A generally pleasing set of results, I picked out [ten that I liked above the rest of them](http://furinkan.meidokon.net/img/20100508_buddha_birthday/).
