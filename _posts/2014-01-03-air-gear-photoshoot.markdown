I was asked by the lovely [Anya Kimochi](https://www.facebook.com/AnyaKimochi) yesterday if I was free for a photoshoot. What, tomorrow? Hoo boy, well if it's in the city I could probably run away from the office for a little bit... That long lunch ended up being a *bit* longer than expected.

Now I'll admit I know nothing about Air Gear except being that it's by the same guy that made heaven-up-heaven-down (ie. [Tenjou Tenge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenjho_Tenge)), and being able to recognise Simca. I'm in luck, Anya is cosplaying Simca today. :) [Michael](https://www.facebook.com/myuki3) is joining us as Ikki, the central protagonist of the series.

We started down in the Empty Knot's underground carpark but I didn't really get any shots that I was pleased with. Things got much better once we went up to the rooftop of the building.

Caption: I really wasn't sure what sort of character Ikki is meant to have, but I reckon his eyebrows look a bit angry here. Lucky for me he's apparently a perverted badass - 1 out of 2 ain't bad.

He told me that he was trying out contouring with makeup for the first time, to try and get a more hard-edged masculine appearance. I think it worked, good job.

It's about 14:00 and the sun is beating down hard. Very harsh shadows but it gives us some nice airy shots that, given the title *Air Gear*, I'm pretty happy about. While we're up here, Simca is meant to be sexy, so I thought we could try a few in that vein.

Caption: Le fashion shot, I should really study the posing details for ones like this. Being able to direct facial expressions would be good too.
