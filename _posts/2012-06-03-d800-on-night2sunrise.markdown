One of the first things I shot with the D800 was a dance battle that I stumbled onto as I was walking home from work one evening. Me being lazy, I didn't bother processing them until now.

Whenever you walk past the Sydney Entertainment Centre at night you'll find someone practising their moves, usually in a little group. Tonight it was a little 2v2 team tournament called [Night2Sunrise](http://ozpoppinseen.wordpress.com/2012/05/03/n2s-autumn-jam-sessions-fri-4th-may-12/). The only dance I know is DDR, but this was really fun to watch.

I'm really digging these over-the-top facial expressions! It's hard not to laugh while trying to shoot.

All I've got on me is the 50mm f/1.4, and that's a good thing. The framing is a bit tight if I want a spot without people blocking my view, but it's pretty workable.

Auto-ISO is an absolute *boss* right now. I've dialed in a fixed shutter and aperture to get reasonably satisfactory levels of motion blur, and let the camera figure out the correct exposure - it's nailing it pretty much constantly.

The focus isn't so good though, as the dancers move too fast to get a lock, and I can't set a fixed distance either for the same reasons.

Looking at these after the fact, the quality of lighting was absolute crap, with a heavy purple cast over everything. I opted to bump everything into black-and-white and push the contrast for a bit of a film-ish look. I reckon it worked pretty well, and I think the copious amounts of camera noise adds to the feel of it all.

This guy was a real character, popping and locking never looked so effortless.

And the judges' decision... the team on their left with a unanimous verdict!
