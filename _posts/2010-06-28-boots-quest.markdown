title: Boots quest
---

For reasons that are difficult to rationally justify, I've really wanted a pair of boots recently. More accurately, another pair. The black knee-highs with six-inch heels are a little impractical at times, and the brown leather ones are a bit small.

It's got something to do with this picture ([full-size, 5.2 MiB]({% link_image maid-sama_white_boots_huge.jpg %})), I'm absolutely entranced by those <span class="nobr">かわいい</span> white boots being worn by Aoi. <small>(P.S. <span class="nobr">かわいい</span> means "cute" in Japanese ^_^ )</small>

One can't be impulsive about such things, so I sought approval from my trusted comrades. A short while later I'd managed to goad enough of them into agreeing that it was a splendid idea. Somewhat more self-assured, I began looking for options.

Alas, there are not many options. Ebay turned up nothing, and the rest of the internet seems to be saturated by a US company called Pleaser. I shan't speak ill of their extensive range (such as the sort-of-close [Arena 2020](http://www.pleaserusa.com/ProductDetail.asp?PROD_CD=ARENA2020%2FW&STYLE_CD=ARENA-2020)), but let us be honest - when your heels *start* at 4" high, and your range includes [blinged-out neon tipjars as platform soles](http://www.pleaserusa.com/ProductDetail.asp?div=1_PLEASER&dpt=50_SPEC&ctg=30_UV&STYLE_CD=TIPJAR-702-5&PROD_CD=TIP702-5%2FC%2FWG), this is not <span class="nobr">かわいい</span>.

I was almost ready to give up at this stage, resigned to my inevitable fate in patent pleather, when I happened upon a Chinese fashion wholesale company. Wholesale is no good, but a little investigation turned up a promising tie to [a Japanese site, with just the right thing](http://www.japan-dress.com/goods-1123520.html). The promise was quickly shattered when it was evident that sizing was going to be a big problem - no reasonable Japanese person needs US ladies' size 11. It was time for the final solution: bespoke.

Actually finding a proper cobbler (or more correctly a "[cordwainer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cordwainer)") seems unnecessarily difficult to me, but the fact is there's a hell of a lot of shoe-repairers out there, but practically no creators. So what's out there?

 * [Andrew McDonald](http://www.andrewmcdonald.com.au/madetoorder/theprocess) - I've walked past this place many times in the uber-trendy boutique strip of Paddington. The lowest price for any custom work is $1100 AUD, maybe a *little* out of my league. To be honest, I really don't like any of the current collection. I'll gladly burn disgusting amounts of money on things I really like, but I'm not *feeling* the style here, it's not the right place to make enquiries for what I want.
 * [Doc Cobbler](http://www.doccobbler.com.au/) - Located in Melbourne. Promising looking, but a bit light on information. The business side is there, but I wanna see more of the "art". You can find it if you poke around, but I wasn't greatly inspired with confidence.
 * [Emma the Shoemaker](http://www.emmatheshoemaker.com/) - For such a visually intense site, I liked how well it worked. I found exactly what I was looking for, and I really like what I saw. I'd go with this, but... she's in Melbourne. Melbourne's a nice place, but even I think this would be a bit excessive to make the trip there.
 * [Mr George Shoes](http://www.mrgeorgeshoes.com.au/) - Right, now we're talking.
