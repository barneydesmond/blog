*To be written.*

Most pleased to have [Rurineko](https://www.facebook.com/kiraracosplay) ask me to assist with a Shironeko ([Oreimo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oreimo)) photoshoot. Eric was a massive help with fill lighting and reflector, and Lewys from [Paradox](http://www.paradoxphotos.com/) was also shooting.

* A lovely warm Sunday afternoon in Sydney, perfect for a Shironeko shoot.
* Had no specific plans, decided to hit up Hyde Park and St Mary's Cathedral. We lined up the Royal Botanic Gardens as a potential location, but ended up not needing it (and not having time anyway).
* Were shooting at about 15:00-16:00, sun was still strong but thankfully not so high in the sky as to cause insurmountable problems. Generous use of reflector and fill-flash kept things workable.
* My 24-70mm is still misbehaving, the output looks great on the LCD but it's clear that it's missing focus when you zoom in to 100% later on.
* Thankfully the 105mm is still rock solid and eye-wateringly beautiful.
