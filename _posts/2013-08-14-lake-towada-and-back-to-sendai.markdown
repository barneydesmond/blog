Got a whole lot of driving lined up for today. Technically it's kinda a free day and I don't *have* to do this, but I hear the area around Lake Towada is [hella beautiful](http://wikitravel.org/en/Towada-Hachimantai_National_Park), so off we go!

Caption: So I've gotta get my car out of Toyoko Inn's autostacker garage thing. Uhh... I think this is how it works.

Caption: The tower is seriously tall, it looks like it holds 12-16 cars in a stack, and there's 4 stacks in total.

{% insert_image 20130814-IMGP0522.jpg %}
Caption: That's a car on the bottom of the stack to give you an idea of what it looks like.

{% insert_image 20130814-IMGP0592.jpg %}
Caption: And this is the tower from the outside, it's taller than the hotel itself.


11:00 get on the motorway

{% insert_image 20130814-IMGP0523.jpg %}
Caption: I was only on the highway for a short time, maybe 15-20 minutes. I got this ticket at the entry point in Aomori, and exited at Kuroishi.

{% insert_image 20130814-IMGP0524.jpg %}
Caption: The area around the tollbooths is really nice, I pulled into this little rest area for a drink once I got off the highway.

11:20 arrive in Kuroishi

{% insert_image 20130814-IMGP0526.jpg %}
Caption: Like pretty much everywhere in Japan, they're big on tourism. This is one of the maps in the rest area. And, like most Japanese area guide maps, it's hard to tell where you are *now* and what direction you're facing.

{% insert_image 20130814-IMGP0528.jpg %}
Caption: I don't even know where I am right now, but the scenery is spectacular.

{% insert_image 20130814-IMGP0531-Edit.jpg %}
Caption: I'm in pursuit of this guy on the mountain roads, am I doing it right?

12:20 Hard drive there, reach the northwest corner of the lake

Caption: I won't lie, it feels like hooning around in Initial D.

{% insert_image 20130814-IMGP0542.jpg %}
Caption: Remember what I said about Japanese maps? WhereTF am I!?

I've hit the lake! Driving down the western shore of it, find a spot to pull over and relax for a bit. Short way down a path with no road access, there at the shore and a sorta-beach.

13:00 bumming around that pier with auto fishing rods

walk around a bit, find public toilets and a sorta useful map, on the steep road up and out of here.

{% insert_image 20130814-20130814_130901.jpg %}
Caption: Area map that actually tells me where I am.

I wish I had time to go hiking around the mointains, but I really don't (rental car has to be back at 15:00)

Caption: The pier and lake, wide shot



13:15 leave the pier

Driving away from Towadako, it's 28 degrees and hit about 90kmh once we're out of town a bit.

Much easier route out of Towada than it was in, nice and flat, easy run.


About 13:30, stop off for some apples

Caption: Indecipherable traffic lights towards Aomori

Have a hard time figuring out how to get on the highway, need to drive a long way and then grab a sudden turnoff. Miss it, have to go a while then drive back.

{% insert_image 20130814-IMGP0588.jpg %}
Caption: Filling up at the service station, rumour has it that sometimes customers enter the shop. Also I like their uniforms.

{% insert_image 20130814-IMGP0608.jpg %}
Caption: Yeah, *this* is the train I really wanted to catch north from Tokyo to Aomori, making the whole trip in about 3hrs, but couldn't. I'm on it now!


18:15 disembark, probably Sendai


21:00 hanging around in Tora

Caption: I have no idea what this is, some muscle-crossover Rozen Maiden thing. I lol'd.

It's late and nothing's open, and Yodobashi Camera is closed. And I've kinda exhausted the arcades too. I know... dinner timer! There's still a couple of things open, like Saizeriya.

Caption: Pizza! Just the right saiz, I think.
