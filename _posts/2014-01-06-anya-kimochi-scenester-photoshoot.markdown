It's been busy these last few days. The Air Gear photoshoot was pretty draining and editing took a while, but I'll never turn down an opportunity to go take more photos. Aru Jei gave me a prod and asked if I wanted to come out for a casual non-cosplay shoot with Anya at Olympic Park. I was still waiting to give him the battery caddy for his D700's grip, so hey why wouldn't I go out today? It's time for a long lunch again, so I brought the laptop to stay connected with the office.

An [ANTI THEâˆžHOLiC](http://vocaloid.wikia.com/wiki/ANTI_THE%E2%88%9EHOLiC) wig chopped into the *scene* style, a gritty singlet top, old jeans and a bright pair of kicks. People, myself included, don't have a firm idea of what being a "scene kid" (to use the sometimes-pejorative) really means beyond stereotypes. Popular understanding includes the visible fashions and little more, with an assumption that it's a coherent alternative subculture thing.

It's not really that, and Urban Dictionary has a [pleasingly thorough entry](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=scene&defid=1449447) on the topic. At its core its about personal expression and social interaction. But enough about that, that's bloody hard to communicate through photos. Let's keep pretending it's all so simple: a scene hairstyle is typically long and cut with a razor to give it a layered and choppy look. It's a bit like emo, but with less black.

So it's an aesthetic shoot today, low-tension and good to practice some simple ideas, some posing, and composition.
