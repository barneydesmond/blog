Let's just ditch reality for a moment, 'cause it's boring. Fantasy is way more interesting. My Steins;Gate fanbook has chara profiles for everyone, let's have a look at Kurisu's.

Caption: **FFFFUUU— 56cm waist!!**

To be fair, it makes enough sense for her to be that skinny when she's only 160cm tall. Okabe towers over her, but it's a normal enough height for a Japanese female.

Now, the latest issue of [the (sydney) magazine](http://thesydneymagazine.smh.com.au/) came out last weekend, and it had an article about models, featuring Miranda Kerr. It's very nice of them to include little fact-boxes for her and the other models they interviewed.

Caption: Ooh, this is just like a heroine character profile from a visual novel, all it's missing is her blood-type and weight.

So Miranda Kerr is my height, and has a 61cm waist. Where did the rest of her go!? I take it all back, visual novels don't seem so unreasonable any more. The real freaks of nature are right here, walking amongst us. All the [other girls they interviewed]({% link_image models_DSC_8839.jpg %}) have ３サイズ hovering around 80/61/90 and a similar height.

Using a corset pulls the waist in to about 65cm, my mind boggles at the idea of anything thinner even existing. \*sigh\* Who said body image issues were a girl thing, eh?
