First on the agenda, [Ano Natsu de Matteru has been licensed](http://www.sentai-filmworks.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=161:sentaifilmworkslicenseswaitinginthesummer&catid=71:press-releases&Itemid=64) by Sentai Filmworks, huzzah! I'm a big fan of the original Onegai Teacher and Onegai Twins, so I'm pretty pleased to hear about it (albeit a few weeks late).

Next, Single8 cameras. There's a lot of love for the format in episode 03, with Remon showing off the Fujica ZC 1000, a pro-grade film camera of its era. They paired it with a great 7.5–75mm zoom lens (49–490mm equivalent I believe), but one of its real strengths is in taking [C-mount](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_mount) lenses. Wide variety of C-mount options aside, you can adapt plenty of *other* mounts to C-mount.

Which is what you can see here. Unless I'm quite mistaken, that's a [Nikon 400mm f/2.8 AF-S](http://imaging.nikon.com/lineup/lens/singlefocal/Telephoto/af-s_400mmf_28g_vr/index.htm) lens (only a few models have the tripod foot facing backwards, and the silhouette confirms it), in the rare light grey finish. On Single8 film that should be about 2600mm equivalent focal length.

As if there weren't already more to her than meets the eye; that camera and lens combo will weigh about 6.5kg, and I bet she knows how to use it.
