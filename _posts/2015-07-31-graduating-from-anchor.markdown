Well, this is an end of an era for me, it's time to open a new chapter in my
life. Today was my last day with Anchor, I've been here for a bit over eight
years.

Rather than rehash the same material, I'll just copy in the announcement I sent
to my colleagues, thank you all for being so awesome about it.

> Anchor is an amazingly nurturing place and a great environment in which to

> To everyone here, thank you, I've had a great time. To people who know me a
> bit better, I've had a *really* great time. Thank you.

> Don't forget to keep growing and learning, it's easy to forget that when
