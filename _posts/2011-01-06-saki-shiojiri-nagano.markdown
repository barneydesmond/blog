Saki locations, out to Shiojiri, which is a couple of stops away on the JR
line.

Snow *between* Nagano and Shiojiri, though little at either end, which was
kinda convenient.

Walked around a shrine adjacent to the rail tracks, lovely place for some quiet
contemplation. Slight chill in the air without being uncomfortable. Practically
soundless despite the location.

No visitors seen nor any residents, but clearly in use.

Some easy stuff around the station, though a building has since been
demolished, which is a pain in the arse.

Travelled back to Nagano and checked for hitting up some remote locations,
would've been 1hr wait, then 100min travel, by which time it'd be 5pm(?) or so.
Even coming back immediately, you'd get back to Nagano at about 8pm - no good.

Wasn't planned, but dug up info on locations in Nagano city itself, found some
near Zenkoujishita on the NagaDen subway line, three stations away.

Easily found, up a somewhat steep hill, some steps. Pressing on, found
ourselves at Zenkouji temple, which is a huge plot of land with many buildings
associated with the temple.

Nagano city was basically built around the temple, hence its size. Gardens very
nice to walk around, there's a model of a cow in one garden... O\_o

Leave as it's getting quite dark, only just 5pm. Snowing lightly, but it's not
lasting on the ground. Back to Nagano station, dinner on the way back,
mcdonalds again.

If nothing else, this is being fairly light on the wallet. 670 for breakfast on
suica (already sunk cost), 790 on konbini sandwiches for lunch, 400 yen for
dinner; 1860 total
