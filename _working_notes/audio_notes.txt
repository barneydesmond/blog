Driven to Nonai station, ~10km east of Aomori proper
Not much here, industrial area
Shipping company right near here
Rundown house, rusted over completely
Hanging sheet of metal squealing back and forth
walked into a big spider web
much cooler, high 20s
reminds me of hot summer days at the beach, when you're all salty with the water on you, wind is hot, feels like it should be cooling you off, but it's just not, because it's too humid

009 - cicadas and unattended shrine

010 - 12th @ 16:42 blue slide and shelter next to shrine

011 - 12th @ 17:10 little seaside town, the breakwall isn't made of the usual tetrahedron shape, little floating island thing in the bay, the beach is a little dirty as opposed to sandy, but it's just like home. there's volleyball nets at the far end, it's really no different. can hear Lion in the background, but sung by guys with filked lyrics

012 - 12th @ 17:30 Lawson on the side of the road, grab some drinks and snacks, expecting to be driving until 20:00 or so. Lush green, gorgeous view of the clouds

013 - Still at the Lawson, smell from home, burning firewood, wafting down the road, started a controlled burn. the fields are just like the movies and anime, little utes driving along

014 - 18:22 stopped in Noheji just on the edge of the water, can hear festival music for Obon, signs said matsuri from 15th to 18th. trees remind me of island trees, Sendai maybe? All the ones I've seen have been tall like pines, these are low and scraggly, maybe 3-4m tall

015 - 18:55 outskirts of Noheji, can't help pulling over all the time, 50km to Mutsu, looking out over the bay. every time I get out the first thing I notice is the sounds. quarter moon in the southwest, just over the mountains. no clouds except very low. light falling fast.

016 - 26:00 amazing room in a handbuilt log cabin. just outside I can hear cicadas and mosquitos. gonna turn the fan off, it's beautifully quiet.


13th

000 - 09:30? birds singing, preparing to leave

001 - 10:35 Osorezan entrance, looks arid, warm, less humid. eggy smell on the way in

004 - it's quiet when there's noone around

005 - inspecting little gravestones with sulphur flowing down around them
