07th - Sakurajima, reached by ferry (or really long road from Kagoshima
 * Bought a little bag of mini-mikans
 * Not much to do apart from walk around, we're gonna get the tour-bus that comes in half an hour or so
 * Walk up the hill to a nearby shrine, it's pleasant but also quiet and completely empty
 * Discuss whether this constitutes inaka
 * Interesting omikuji ties on the trees
 * Duck-shaped one
 * Walk back down and get on the bus, little scratchie card system
 * Hop out at each spot for 5-15min

 * God rays!
 * Got the ferry back, it's a pleasant 30min or so
 * Checked out the fares to get the ferry or jetfoil to Yakushima, the foil is really expensive! Like twice the cost of the slow ferry
 * There's three main islands in the area served by the boats, along with Kagoshima itself. Yakushima, Tanegashima and Ibusuki
 * 7700 from Kagoshima to Yakushima, or 3400 by slow ferry. The jetfoil is quicker, but still a long time, about 2hrs or 2:40 depending (for some reason)
 * The ferry takes 4hrs, that's okay. But there's a catch - there's one vessel and it does one round-trip per day, which means we need to make the one service that departs at 08:30am.

 * There's a hotel, an illumination space, and a great view of the town
 * Went to the konbini and got lots of snacks
 * Get back to the hotel (Toyoko) and feel like shit, pass out for a bit. Wake up, throw up, feel much better, Ast showers
